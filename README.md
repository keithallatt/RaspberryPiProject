# RaspberryPiProject
Software developed in the Raspbian environment (Debian optimized for the Raspberry Pi) to enable task upload, manipulation, completion and reporting in Python. 

## What I'm Learning
- How to use Python to automate task manipulation and completion.
- How to use Apache and PHP to make a web server.

## About

Much like some companies purchase ‘processing power’ from other computers around the world to ‘crunch the numbers’ when it comes to accomplishing computationally heavy work, this Raspberry Pi Project (R.P.P.) is aimed at off-loading computational work to a network of Raspberry Pis. Using a network of model A+s, we plan on making a small scale, proof of concept cluster, using one master RasPi and many slave RasPis. Much of the software required is implemented on a single RasPi and a configuration file will coordinate the rest.

## Motivation 

The motivation behind this project is not one of necessity, but one of learning. We’re attempting this project to learn more about the Linux operating system, networking, single board computers and their uses, and automation.
This project can also be used as an addition to my portfolio, and all code will be open sourced on GitHub. Full tutorials and documentation will be provided on GitHub.
